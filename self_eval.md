# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Not a ton, I hope I did it right. Things feel like they're finally starting to click.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It's going well. I'm trying to be really diligent about it. I'm starting to incorporate red and blue into my note taking. It takes time but I feel like it makes things a lot clearer. My note taking is definitely evolving over time.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Solving in my code first then google. The up arrow to call the last cmd given in terminal is a lifesaver. Sometimes though I've just been copying and pasting problems to replit and just doing them there. It's a quick way to see results and its handy to be able to just comment things out and be able to come back and look. I feel like I'm absolutely going to be using replit alot for lesson based practices. It's great to have a record of your work.
